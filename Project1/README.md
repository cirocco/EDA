#Instructions

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In 
particular, it uses the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”, available immediately below:

**Dataset:** [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20Mb]

The project recreates four(4) "fast" plots of variables within the data, as specified on the assignment page, [visible here.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/peer/ylVFo/course-project-1) The plots and the code that creates them are included in this directory.

**Description:** Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

###Variables###

**Date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

**Time:** time in format hh:mm:ss

**Global_active_power:** household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

**Global_reactive_power:** household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

**Voltage:** minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

**Global_intensity:** household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

**Sub_metering_1:** energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

**Sub_metering_2:** energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

**Sub_metering_3:** energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
